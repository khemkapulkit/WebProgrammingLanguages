			<h2>Projects</h2>  
			<ul>
				<li>
				<h3>Web Application Development using Object Oriented Programming and Design</h3>
				<p>Fall 14</p>
				<p>Under the guidance of Dr. Mehra Nouroz Borazjan, we designed an application for carpooling at <span title = "University of Texas at Dallas" >UTD</span> using Spring MVC framework. </p>
				</li>
				<li>
				<h3>Internet of Things - One Touch Access to Web Services</h3>
				<p>Spring 15</p>
				<p>This project creates an easy and a convenient way to discover and use nearby smart things. It is a discovery service wherein a smart object br/oadcasts relevant URL’s that a nearby device can receive. This is a unique and interesting way to interact with the web.<br/>In this project we develop an automated system for user interaction with the smart device embedded at various places, in our case at a Restaurant. A universal android application is installed on user’s mobile phone. This application interacts with the smart device (containing Raspberry Pi) using near field communication, to obtain the address of the server for the application. The user then uses his internet connection and the server address to communicate with the server to get access to the various services being provided.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				<h3>Morris Game Design using Artificial Intelligence Algorithms</h3>
				<p>Summer 15</p>
				<p>Designed variations of Morris - Variant D game, in which the computer determined its next moves using the Minimax and the Alpha - Beta Pruning Algorithms. </p>
				</li>
				<li>
				<h3>Efficient Selection of Access Based on Path Quality (Course: Computer Networks)</h3>
				<p>Fall 14</p>
				<p>Under of guidance of Dr. Khiem Le we designed the most efficient path between two hosts are selected using the data obtained from the pinger on each path.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				<h3>Bank Simulation using threads and semaphore to synchronize tasks</h3>
				<p>Fall 14</p>
				<p>Under the guidance of Professor Greg Ozbr/in we made threads for customers and for different tasks performed by bank. These threads are coordinated using semaphores. </p>
				</li>
				<li>
				<h3>Hardware Implementation of Iris Feature Extraction</h3>
				<p>Spring 14</p>
				<p>Under Guidance of Dr. Kota Solomon Raju (Principal Scientist CEERI) I wrote hardware language code for 2D Haar Wavelet and Histogram Equalization for Iris Image Feature Extraction and tested the same on FPGA.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				<h3>Signal Processing Techniques used for Structural Health Monitoring</h3>
				<p>Fall 13</p>
				<p>Under Guidance of Dr. Kota Solomon Raju (Principal Scientist CEERI) wrote hardware language code for 8 to 128 point Fast Fourier Transform, FIR Filter, 1D Haar Wavelet and Bi-orthogonal Wavelet Transform and implemented the same on FPGA.</p>
				</li>

			<h2>Work Experience</h2>
			<ul>
			<li>
				<h3>Software Development Intern</h3>
				<p>Company Name - DKG Labs</p>
				<p>Summer 12</p>
				<p>Developed an android application for GPS tracking of mining trucks at a mining site and transferring data to the central server. Android Application was developed using Android Development Kit in Java and programming done on server was done using C#.</p>
